Hey everyone! 👋

  I've been working on a browser-based card counting trainer called Backroom Blackjack and would love some feedback from people who actually know the game.

  It's set in a 1920s speakeasy vibe with AI players at the table, a pit boss who watches your betting patterns, and dealers with different personalities (some will cover for you, others... not so much).

  What it does:
  - Practice Hi-Lo counting with running/true count tracking
  - Adjustable deck penetration and table rules
  - The pit boss actually tracks if you're varying your bets with the count
  - AI tablemates have conversations and react to the game
  - Basic strategy hints if you want them

  What I'm looking for:
  - Does the counting practice feel realistic?
  - Is the suspicion/heat system too aggressive or too lenient?
  - Any features you wish it had?
  - Bugs (there are probably some)

  You'll need to create a free account to play (just email/password, no payment info). Still a work in progress but it's at a point where I'd love real card counters to poke at it.

Conversations change color if between hands.


  Appreciate any feedback, even if it's "this sucks because X" - that's genuinely helpful!
